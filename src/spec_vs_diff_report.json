  "summary": "The diff adds client-side handling to render a SharedItineraryPage when a `?share=<id>` (or hash `#share=<id>`) parameter is present, but it does not include evidence of changes that would publish the draft as a live public URL or improve deployment reliability/build diagnostics as requested.",

      "id": "REQ-9",
      "requirement": "Publish the currently deployed draft version as the public live version of the app (live non-preview public URL available and loads successfully).",
      "reason": "No changes related to deployment configuration, canister/frontend hosting setup, or release/publish steps are shown in the diff; only in-app routing behavior is modified.",

      "requirement": "Investigate and fix build/deploy issues to make deployments reliably complete; ensure clean frontend TypeScript build; provide actionable error output identifying failure stage if deploy fails.",
      "reason": "The diff does not show changes to build tooling, CI/deploy scripts, dfx/canister deployment configuration, or logging/error staging. App code changes alone do not demonstrate improved deployment reliability or actionable stage-specific build/deploy errors.",
