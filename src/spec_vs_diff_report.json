  "summary": "Hero component was updated to render a full-viewport, object-cover cruise ship background with a gradient fallback on load error and a readability overlay. However, the required static image asset was not added to the public assets path in the diff, and there are additional unrelated metadata/file-summary updates not requested.",

      "requirement": "Ensure the cruise ship hero image asset is available as a static public asset at frontend/public/assets/generated/cruise-ship-hero.dim_1600x900.jpg and referenced consistently from the Hero component using the exact path /assets/generated/cruise-ship-hero.dim_1600x900.jpg.",
      "reason": "The Hero component references the required path, but the diff shows no new file added under frontend/public/assets/generated/, so the required asset’s existence/serving cannot be verified from the changes.",
