  "summary": "REQ-1 appears implemented via a new App Status & Live Link section in the Admin Settings dialog with runtime-derived URL and copy-to-clipboard toast. Evidence for REQ-2 (backend public diagnostics query returning canister principal + version/timestamp and frontend hook wiring) and REQ-3 (Going Live Checklist panel) is not present in the provided diff excerpts, so they cannot be verified as implemented.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Expose a backend query that returns deployment diagnostics (at minimum: backend canister principal and a backend-reported timestamp/version string), and surface it in the “App Status / Live Link” section with non-blocking error handling.",
      "reason": "The frontend section references `useGetBackendDiagnostics()` and renders version/timestamp, but the diff excerpt does not show the hook implementation nor any backend `public query` method that returns canister principal + a backend-generated string/timestamp. With the provided truncated evidence, the required backend API and the actor/react-query wiring cannot be confirmed.",

      "requirement": "Add a short, English “Going Live Checklist” panel in the “App Status / Live Link” section (incognito/private verification + diagnostics should load note; no builder UI references).",
      "reason": "The provided AppStatusLiveLinkSection excerpt shows Live URL and Backend Diagnostics UI, but no checklist panel text is visible in the truncated content, so this requirement cannot be verified as implemented.",
