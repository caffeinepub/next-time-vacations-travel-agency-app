      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "On the homepage, the hero area uses the full viewport height (e.g., equivalent to Tailwind's h-screen/min-h-screen) instead of a fixed height.",
        "The cruise ship image (/assets/generated/cruise-ship-hero.dim_1600x900.jpg) visually covers the full hero area (no empty side space), cropping as needed rather than letterboxing.",
        "Hero text/CTAs remain visible on top of the full-screen image and are still readable in both light and dark modes.",
        "No changes are required in the backend; this is a styling/layout-only update."
